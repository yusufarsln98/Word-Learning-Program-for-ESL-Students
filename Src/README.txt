In multi-word lists, the probability will increase when a word is incorrectly known, but this will not be at noticeable levels.
For this reason, I also added a short list of words. It is possible that when you spend some time, 
you may notice that the possibilities change, but please note that they are only a possibility.
You can use the small-size word list by changing the definition of SYNONYMS into the "synonymsshort.txt"
and ANTONYMS in to the "antonymsshort.txt".
Thank you.
