# Word Learning Program for ESL Students

The program helps an ESL (English as a Second Language) student with synonyms and antonyms.

In this program, the correct and incorrect answers of the user are recorded, and the likelihood of incorrect answers being asked again is increased.

The program is a console application and was developed as the final project of the CSE102 Computer Programming course using the C programming language.
